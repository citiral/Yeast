engine:
collision detection
xml support
post processing
resource loading
resize support

game:
movement
level system
gameplay systems

other:


design posibilities:
	flashpunk like:
		no ide
		library dll
		game links against library
		code can be in c++

	scripted:
		seperate ide:
			game engine knows about scripts
			seperate framework project as ide
			ide allows for live editing, as a full editor,..
			difficult for representing engine stuff outside of the viewport

		in-engine ide:
			bloat engine?
			difficult to make clean looking?



engine is seperate library
engine knows nothing about data on hard drive. has callbacks to fetch data and caches it
framework knows about data on hard drive, feeds it to the engine
